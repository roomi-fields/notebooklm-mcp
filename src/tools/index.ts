**Active Notebook:** ${active.name}
**Content:** ${active.description}
**Topics:** ${topics}

> Auth tip: If login is required, use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-setup' and then verify with the 'get_health' tool. If authentication later fails (e.g., expired cookies), use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-repair'.

## What This Tool Is
- Full conversational research with Gemini (LLM) grounded on your notebook sources
- Session-based: each follow-up uses prior context for deeper, more precise answers
- Source-cited responses designed to minimize hallucinations

## When To Use
${useCases}

## Rules (Important)
- Always prefer continuing an existing session for the same task
- If you start a new thread, create a new session and keep its session_id
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing; do not guess missing details
- If multiple notebooks could apply, propose the top 1–2 and ask which to use
- If task context changes, ask to reset the session or switch notebooks
- If authentication fails, use the prompts 'notebooklm.auth-repair' (or 'notebooklm.auth-setup') and verify with 'get_health'
- After every NotebookLM answer: pause, compare with the user's goal, and only respond if you are 100% sure the information is complete. Otherwise, plan the next NotebookLM question in the same session.

## Session Flow (Recommended)
\`\`\`javascript
// 1) Start broad (no session_id → creates one)
ask_question({ question: "Give me an overview of [topic]" })
// ← Save: result.session_id

// 2) Go specific (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Key APIs/methods?", session_id })

// 3) Cover pitfalls (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Common edge cases + gotchas?", session_id })

// 4) Ask for production example (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Show a production-ready example", session_id })
\`\`\`

## Automatic Multi-Pass Strategy (Host-driven)
- Simple prompts return once-and-done answers.
- For complex prompts, the host should issue follow-up calls:
  1. Implementation plan (APIs, dependencies, configuration, authentication).
  2. Pitfalls, gaps, validation steps, missing prerequisites.
- Keep the same session_id for all follow-ups, review NotebookLM's answer, and ask more questions until the problem is fully resolved.
- Before replying to the user, double-check: do you truly have everything? If not, queue another ask_question immediately.

## 🔥 REAL EXAMPLE

Task: "Implement error handling in n8n workflow"

Bad (shallow):
\`\`\`
Q: "How do I handle errors in n8n?"
A: [basic answer]
→ Implement → Probably missing edge cases!
\`\`\`

Good (deep):
\`\`\`
Q1: "What are n8n's error handling mechanisms?" (session created)
A1: [Overview of error handling]

Q2: "What's the recommended pattern for API errors?" (same session)
A2: [Specific patterns, uses context from Q1]

Q3: "How do I handle retry logic and timeouts?" (same session)
A3: [Detailed approach, builds on Q1+Q2]

Q4: "Show me a production example with all these patterns" (same session)
A4: [Complete example with full context]

→ NOW implement with confidence!
\`\`\`
    
## Notebook Selection
- Default: active notebook (${active.id})
- Or set notebook_id to use a library notebook
- Or set notebook_url for ad-hoc notebooks (not in library)
- If ambiguous which notebook fits, ASK the user which to use`;
  } else {
    return `# Conversational Research Partner (NotebookLM • Gemini 2.5 • Session RAG)

## No Active Notebook
- Visit https://notebooklm.google to create a notebook and get a share link
- Use **add_notebook** to add it to your library (explains how to get the link)
- Use **list_notebooks** to show available sources
- Use **select_notebook** to set one active

> Auth tip: If login is required, use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-setup' and then verify with the 'get_health' tool. If authentication later fails (e.g., expired cookies), use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-repair'.

Tip: Tell the user you can manage NotebookLM library and ask which notebook to use for the current task.`;

        `🚀 AUTO-DISCOVERY — Automatically generate notebook metadata via NotebookLM (RECOMMENDED)

## When to Use
- User provides NotebookLM URL and wants quick/automatic setup
- User prefers not to manually specify metadata
- Default choice for adding notebooks

## Workflow
1) User provides NotebookLM URL
2) Ask confirmation: "Add '[URL]' with auto-generated metadata?"
3) Call this tool → NotebookLM generates name, description, tags
4) Show generated metadata to user for review

## Benefits
- ✅ 30 seconds vs 5 minutes manual entry
- ✅ Zero-friction notebook addition
- ✅ Consistent metadata quality
- ✅ Discovers topics user might not think of

## Example
User: "Add this NotebookLM: https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/abc123"
You: "Add this notebook with auto-generated metadata?"
User: "Yes"
You: Call auto_discover_notebook(url="https://...")
→ Returns: {name: "n8n-workflow-guide", description: "...", tags: [...]}

## Fallback
If auto-discovery fails (rare), use add_notebook tool for manual entry.

        `📝 MANUAL ENTRY — Add notebook with manually specified metadata (use auto_discover_notebook instead)

## When to Use
- Auto-discovery failed or unavailable
- User has specific metadata requirements
- User prefers manual control

## Conversation Workflow (Mandatory)
When the user says: "I have a NotebookLM with X"

**FIRST:** Try auto_discover_notebook for faster setup
**ONLY IF** user refuses auto-discovery or it fails:

1) Ask URL: "What is the NotebookLM URL?"
2) Ask content: "What knowledge is inside?" (1–2 sentences)
3) Ask topics: "Which topics does it cover?" (3–5)
4) Ask use cases: "When should we consult it?"
5) Propose metadata and confirm:
   - Name: [suggested]
   - Description: [from user]
   - Topics: [list]
   - Use cases: [list]
   "Add it to your library now?"
6) Only after explicit "Yes" → call this tool

## Rules
- Do not add without user permission
- Prefer auto_discover_notebook when possible
- Do not guess metadata — ask concisely
- Confirm summary before calling the tool

## Example
User: "I have a notebook with n8n docs"
You: "Want me to auto-generate the metadata?" (offer auto_discover_notebook first)
User: "No, I'll specify it myself"
You: Ask URL → content → topics → use cases; propose summary
User: "Yes"
You: Call add_notebook

## When To Use
- User switches context: "Let's work on React now"
- User asks explicitly to activate a notebook
- Obvious task change requires another notebook

## Auto-Switching
- Safe to auto-switch if the context is clear and you announce it:
  "Switching to React notebook for this task..."
- If ambiguous, ask: "Switch to [notebook] for this task?"

## Example
User: "Now let's build the React frontend"
You: "Switching to React notebook..." (call select_notebook)`,
